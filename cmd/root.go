	Long: `ondevice wraps your favourite ssh-based tools (ssh, sftp, rsync, etc.)
to give you access to all your devices, even if they're in another network.`,
	Example: `- initially log in to your account
  $ ondevice login

- connect to your NAS (i.e. device named 'nas')
  $ ondevice ssh nas

- run apt-get on your office pc
  $ ondevice ssh office apt-get -y install vim

- copy files using rsync (requires rsync to be installed on both hosts)
  $ ondevice rsync -av office:~/Documents/Project-XY ~/Documents/Work-Stuff/

- set up port forwarding to a psql server that only accepts local connections
  $ ondevice ssh -L 54320:localhost:5432 -f -N user@webserver
  $ psql -h localhost -p 54320 -U webapp -W webapp`,
