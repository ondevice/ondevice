// scpCmd represents the scp command
var scpCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "scp [scp args...] [[user1@]host1:]file1 ... [[userN@]hostN:]fileN",
	Short: "copy files from/to your devices using scp",
	Long: `copy files from/to devices using scp

Notes:
- while it is possible to copy files between two servers, scp will initiate
  both connections simultaneously causing two concurrent password prompts
  which won't work (unless of course you've set up ssh_agent properly).
- uses scp's '-3' flag (allowing files to be copied between two remote devices)
- We use our own known_hosts file (in ~/.config/ondevice/known_hosts).
  Override with ''-oUserKnownHostsFile=...'`,
	Example: `- copy the local /src/path to myDev's /target/path/ as root
  (and pass the -p and -v options to scp)
  $ ondevice scp -pv /source/path/ root@myDev:/target/path/

- copy otherDev's /etc/motd file to /tmp/other.motd (and login as 'me')
  $ ondevice scp me@otherDev:/etc/motd /tmp/other.motd`,
	Run:               scpRun,
	ValidArgsFunction: scpValidate,
}
