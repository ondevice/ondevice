var rsyncCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "rsync [rsync args...]",
	Short: "copy files from/to your devices using rsync",
	Long: `copy files from/to devices using rsync

	Examples:

	- ondevice rsync -av /source/path/ root@myDev:/target/path/
	    copy the local /src/path to myDev's /target/path/ as root
	    (and pass the -a and -v options to rsync)
	- ondevice rsync me@otherDev:/etc/motd /tmp/other.motd
	    copy otherDev's /etc/motd file to /tmp/other.motd (and login as 'me')

	This command is only a thin wrapper around the 'rsync' client (using its '-e'
	argument to make it use 'ondevice ssh' internally).

	Have a look at the rsync man page for further details.
