This is a relatively thin wrapper around the 'ssh' command.
The main difference to invoking ssh directly is that instead of regular host names you'll have to specify an ondevice deviceId.
The connection is routed through the ondevice.io network.

ondevice ssh will try to parse ssh's arguments, the first non-argument has to be
the user@devId combo.

See ssh's documentation for further details.

Notes:
- We use our own known_hosts file (in ~/.config/ondevice/known_hosts).
  Override with ''-oUserKnownHostsFile=...'`,
		Example: `- simply connect to device1:
  $ ondevice ssh device1

- open an SSH connection to device1, logging in as 'user':
  $ ondevice ssh user@device1

- run 'echo hello world' on device1:
  $ ondevice ssh device1 echo hello world

- tunnel the HTTP server on device1 to the local port 1234 without opening
  a shell:
  $ ondevice ssh device1 -N -L 1234:localhost:80

- start a SOCKS5 proxy listening on port 1080. It'll redirect all traffic
  to the target host:
  $ ondevice ssh device1 -D 1080`,
		Run:               c.run,
		ValidArgsFunction: internal.DeviceListCompletion{}.Run,
