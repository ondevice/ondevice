// rsyncCmd represents the rsync command
var rsyncCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "rsync [rsync args...]",
	Short: "copy files from/to your devices using rsync",
	Long: `copy files from/to devices using rsync

This command is only a thin wrapper around the 'rsync' client (using its '-e'
argument to make it use 'ondevice ssh' internally).

Have a look at the rsync man page for further details.`,
	Example: `- copy the local /src/path to myDev's /target/path/ as root
  (and pass the -a and -v options to rsync)
  $ ondevice rsync -av /source/path/ root@myDev:/target/path/

- copy otherDev's /etc/motd file to /tmp/other.motd (and login as 'me')
  $ ondevice rsync me@otherDev:/etc/motd /tmp/other.motd`,
	Run:               rsyncRun,
	ValidArgsFunction: scpValidate,
}
